🎯 AI Image Gallery - Developer Challenge

📋 Project Overview
Build a web application where users can upload images, get automatic AI-generated tags and descriptions, and search through their images using text or find similar images.

🎭 Core Requirements

1️⃣ Authentication
* Implement Supabase Auth (email/password)
* Sign up / Sign in pages
* Protected routes (gallery only accessible when logged in)
* Each user sees only their own images
* Logout functionality

2️⃣ Image Management
* Upload single or multiple images (drag & drop)
* Support JPEG, PNG formats
* Generate one thumbnail size (300x300)
* Store original + thumbnail
* Show upload progress
* Basic image grid view

3️⃣ AI Analysis
* Research & Choose: Select an appropriate AI service for image analysis
* Document why you chose this service (cost, features, ease of use)
* Include comparison of at least 2 options you considered

Required AI Features:
* Generate 5-10 relevant tags per image
* Create one descriptive sentence about the image
* Extract dominant colors (top 3)
* Process images async in background

4️⃣ Search Features
* Text Search: Search by tags or description
* Similar Images: Click "find similar" on any image
* Filter by Color: Click a color to find similar colored images
* Results should update without page reload
* Search only within user's own images

5️⃣ Frontend Requirements
* Auth Pages: Clean login/signup forms
* Gallery View: Responsive grid layout
* Image Modal: Click to view larger + see tags/description
* Search Bar: With instant results
* Upload Zone: Drag & drop area
* Loading States: Skeleton screens while processing
* User Menu: Show email and logout option
* Mobile responsive

6️⃣ Technical Requirements
* Use Supabase for auth and database
* Images processed in background (don't block upload)
* Handle errors gracefully (AI API failures)
* Paginate results (20 images per page)
* Basic caching of AI results
* Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data

📊 Suggested Tech Stack

Backend:
* Supabase (required for auth & database)
* Any backend language for AI processing:
  - FastAPI (Python) - recommended
  - Express.js (Node.js)
  - Edge Functions (Supabase)

Database:
* Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* Use Row Level Security (RLS)

Frontend:
* React or Vue.js
* Any CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
* Vanilla JS also acceptable if well-structured

AI Integration:
* Your researched choice
* For similarity: cosine similarity on tags/colors
* No need for complex vector databases

Storage:
* Supabase Storage for images
* Organize by user_id folders

🔧 Simple Database Schema
sql
CREATE TABLE images (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    filename VARCHAR(255),
    original_path TEXT,
    thumbnail_path TEXT,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE image_metadata (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    image_id INTEGER REFERENCES images(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    description TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    colors VARCHAR(7)[],
    ai_processing_status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE image_metadata ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see own images" ON images
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only see own metadata" ON image_metadata
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

📝 Deliverables
1. GitHub repository with code
2. README with:
   - Setup instructions
   - API keys needed
   - Architecture decisions
   - AI service comparison document
3. Screenshots or short demo video
4. List of potential improvements

💡 Implementation Tips
* Start simple: Auth → Upload → Display → Add AI → Add Search
* Use Supabase quickstart guides for auth setup
* Test AI services with free tiers before committing
* Focus on core features first
* Console.log AI responses to understand the data
* Test with 5-10 images initially

🚫 What NOT to Do
* Don't overcomplicate the similarity search
* Don't build custom auth (use Supabase)
* Don't optimize prematurely
* Don't spend too much time on CSS
* Skip complex deployment configs
* Don't implement social login (just email/password)

📌 Example User Flow
1. User signs up with email/password
2. User logs in and sees empty gallery
3. User drags 3 vacation photos to upload area
4. Images appear in gallery with loading spinner
5. AI processes each image in background
6. Tags appear: "beach, sunset, ocean, people, vacation"
7. User searches "sunset" → sees relevant images
8. User clicks "Find similar" → sees other beach photos
9. User filters by blue color → sees ocean/sky images
10. User logs out and images are no longer accessible
